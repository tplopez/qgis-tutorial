# Tutorial 1: Why QGIS or ESRI ArcGIS


## Overview

In this tutorial, we will briefly talk about the main differences between ESRI ArcGIS and QGIS. Although it is expected that those who attend the tutorial already completed the QGIS installation process, we will also briefly cover the installation for Mac OSX. In geographical information systems software, there are different types of data to deal with. There are two main types, vector, and raster data. We will go through the basics in this section since we will be explaining more in the next tutorials. Finally, I will point to different sources of free GIS data that I have used in the past.
