# EWRI QGIS Tutorial Session
Organized by Tania Lopez-Cantu

November 30th, 2018

As environmental engineers, we often need to work with data that has an associated spatial dimension. For instance, working with samples across a river, working with weather station networks, among other examples. Geographical Information System software provides numerous advantages when working with such data. ESRI ArcGIS and the open source QGIS are very common tools that have many implemented functions that work specifically for spatial data.

In this tutorial session, we will introduce the use of QGIS and work through three different tutorials targeted to no-experience and beginner users. The purpose is to give the attendees a general idea about the capabilities of this software. This tutorial is not intended to cover everything that can be done in QGIS (for that there is a course offered in the department, and another in Heinz, that uses ESRI ArcGIS!) but instead give a chance to graduate students who are interested or curious about this software, and by attending this tutorial and grasping the basics, might find it useful for their research/coursework/future careers to deepen their knowledge by attending the courses offered at CMU.

Each Tutorial section is organized by first stating the objectives that the tutorial aims to cover followed by the data to be used in the tutorial with its respective download links and a link to the different steps within the tutorial. If there is no download link for a particular dataset, it can be downloaded through this repository.

Remember, this is not a QGIS user manual. For more information on QGIS, please visit [the official QGIS manual](https://docs.qgis.org/2.8/en/docs/training_manual/index.html)

# Provide Feedback

The tutorial session is the very first session offered by the Environmental and Water Resources Graduate Student Chapter at CMU, and we hope to expand into other topics depending on the interest of the attendees. How can this tutorial be improved? Did you want other topics to be covered?

We would like to hear your comments, please share them [here.](https://goo.gl/forms/DOeMAnqMDkviyD7w1)
